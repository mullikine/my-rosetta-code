* Append to each line
Even shorter than the :search command:

#+BEGIN_SRC text :async :results verbatim drawer
  :%norm A*
  This is what it means:
  
   %       = for every line
   norm    = type the following commands
   A*      = append '*' to the end of current line
#+END_SRC

* [#A] Shortcut

#+BEGIN_SRC vimrc :async :results verbatim drawer
  " Append to line
  xnoremap A :%norm A
#+END_SRC

** [#A] Made it line-wise only
#+BEGIN_SRC vimrc :async :results verbatim drawer
  " Append to line
  " xnoremap A :%norm A

  " Make it linewise-only
  " v -> charwise
  " V -> linewise
  " C-v -> blockwise
  xno <expr> A  {'v':      targets#e('A', 'A'),
               \ 'V':      "\<esc>:norm A",
               \ "\<c-v>": targets#e('A', 'A'),
               \ }[mode()]

  " annoyingly, the targets function creates weird keyboard input reads / delays.
  " xno <silent> <expr> A { 'v': targets#e('A', 'A'), 'V': ":norm A", "\<c-v>": targets#e('A', 'A') }[mode()]
  " Therefore evaluate them in advance. It simply resolves to 'A'
  xno <expr> A { 'v': "A", 'V': ":norm A", "\<c-v>": "A" }[mode()]
#+END_SRC
